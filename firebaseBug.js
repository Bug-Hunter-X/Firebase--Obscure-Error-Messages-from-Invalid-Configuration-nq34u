The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the provided configuration is invalid or missing. This can be tricky to debug because the error messages aren't always clear.  For example, if you're missing the `apiKey` in your `firebaseConfig` object, the error might be quite generic, making it hard to pinpoint the exact issue.  Another example is related to security rules. If your rules are too restrictive, you might get a permission denied error without a clear indication of which part of your code is causing the problem.  Incorrectly structured data, such as sending an object where an array is expected, can also lead to confusing error messages.
